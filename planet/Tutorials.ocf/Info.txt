[General Tutorial Concept]
Create a short adventure with a basic story line where the player is gradually learning the controls of OpenClonk. The general elements involve a wipf, he is the little animal friend of the clonk and shows the path most of the times. Other elements are exploring, settlement and battles.

[Tutorial Story Line] (every * is one tutorial)
* Clonk is stranded with its wipf on a small beach. The wipf runs off into a cave and the player needs to follow him to the end of the tutorial, where they are reunited. 
* After being reunited the wipf decides to run off again, and is now trapped and lost. The player will need to find and free him, after that the wipf needs to be fed to strengthen him. Finally the player and the wipf continue their journey to the end of the scenario.
* The player then walks together with the wipf into a settlement with a destroyed wipf statue (first introduction with the evil wipf fraction). The statue will be repaired using some metal melted from coal and ore and some wood from trees.
* Construction of a defense tower against attacks from the evil wipf fraction.

* Attack of the evil wipf fraction.
