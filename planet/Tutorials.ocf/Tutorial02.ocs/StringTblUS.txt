MsgTutorialIntro=It seems your little friend is lost again, he's quite a character! Wipfs tend to spend quite some time underground cause of their craving for digging, so you might find him there. For now just proceed to the right.
MsgTutorialShovel=There is a shovel over there! Clonks need equipment to perform certain tasks, the shovel is used for digging. An object, like the shovel, is automatically picked up by the clonk if its hands are free. This is indicated in the inventory shown at the bottom of the screen.
MsgTutorialDigging=Now that you are holding shovel, you better use it. Hold the left mouse button to use the object you are holding, currently the shovel, to start digging in the direction you are pointing towards.
MsgTutorialFirestones=Watch out! The reddish material ahead is dangerous, if you dig through this material firestones will appear. These are fragile and highly explosive, luckily the clonk picks them up automatically when they are in range. Be sure to pick up a couple, they might come in handy.
MsgTutorialFoundWipf=Almost found your wipf, but a patch of rock is in the way. Rock can not be dug away and must be blown. Throw some firestones on the rock, but keep your distance! Select the firestones in the inventory by pressing the corresponding button or by scrolling the mouse wheel, then click the right mouse button in the direction you want to throw.
MsgTutorialBlastedRock=Well done, you blasted the rock and found your friend! He seems exhausted, bring him some food, for example the mushrooms in the caves around. To drop an item press Shift plus the inventory number key while standing close to the Wipf.
MsgTutorialFedWipf=That has done him good! Now lead your little friend to the settlement located further to the right.
MsgTutorialDigOutLoam=This way! These orange objects ahead are pieces of loam, dig them out and collect a few. Loam can be used to build bridges out of earth, hold the left mouse button to construct a bridge in the direction of the mouse cursor.
MsgTutorialFragileBridge=Wait a second... That bridge looks highly fragile, and below there is acid, which is very dangerous. You should let your wipf go ahead to probe the bridge since he is much lighter.
MsgTutorialMakeLoamBridge=I told you so, it was fragile after all, luckily your friend made it. Use the pieces of loam to construct a bridge to safely pass the acid below and get to your furry friend.
MsgTutorialCompleted=Well done! Let's proceed to the next tutorial.
