MsgTutorialIntro=You made it into Wipfville, it seems that it has been under attack by some evil fraction. Follow your friend for a while, he seems to be attracted by something.
MsgTutorialStatue=It seems that the landmark of Wipfville has been destroyed. Maybe you should help rebuilding it! Descend into the ore mine below to gather some metal.
MsgTutorialDynamiteLorry=There is a lorry filled with dynamite. You can access the contents of many vehicles and buildings by pressing [E], which opens the interaction menu. You can interchange items between different containers by clicking them. Grab a few sticks of dynamite!
MsgTutorialBlastOre=Perfect, with dynamite you can blast the ore to the right, ore is used to produce metal. Stand next to the ore material and select one of the dynamite sticks, press the left mouse button once to fuse it and press another time in the direction of the ore to stick it into the wall. Then run!
MsgTutorialPickUpOre=Ore chunks are quite heavy and can only be picked up with two hands, stand in front of one and press [Space] to pick it up.
MsgTutorialOreToFoundry=While carrying a heavy object, clonks are less agile and can't climb for example. Bring this chunk of ore to the foundry located above, open the contents menu with [E] and drop the chunk of ore.
MsgTutorialCoalToFoundry=Well done, you also need coal to produce metal. Coal is the black material to the left side of the lorry below. You can just dig out a chunk of coal, pick it up and carry it over here.
MsgTutorialProduceMetal=Now that you have brought both coal and ore into the foundry you can produce metal. For production buildings an additional submenu appears when pressing [E], called \"Production\". Here click on the metal picture to start producing one bar of metal.
MsgTutorialFindAxe=The metal is being produced, in the meanwhile we can focus on acquiring wood. For that we need an axe, it is located underground to the left. Jump towards the arrow and while hanging activate and stick a piece of dynamite into the wall, then let go. Now enter the path you opened and grab the axe.
MsgTutorialDropMetal=Go back to forest to the left of the wipf statue, don't forget to pick up the piece of metal on the way. Metal is also heavy and can be picked up using space, drop the piece of metal into the construction site using the contents menu [E]. 
MsgTutorialChopTree=Stand next to a tree and use the axe to start chopping, be sure to not stand exactly in front of it. You can use the axe as well to cut a fallen tree into pieces of wood.
MsgTutorialConstructStatue=Pick up the two pieces of wood and walk in front of the wipf statue. Press [E] to access a construction site and drop of the necessary materials. Then the structure will be built automatically.
MsgTutorialCompleted=Well done! The villagers of Wipfville will be grateful. Let's proceed to the next tutorial.
